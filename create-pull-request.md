   ```
   This PR adds SHA256 checksum verification to the plugin bundling scripts to ensure the integrity and security of downloaded plugins.

   The implementation:
   - Enhances app/scripts/setup-plugins.js to verify checksums when downloading plugins
   - Enhances container/fetch-plugins.sh to verify checksums when downloading plugins
   - Adds plugins/headlamp-plugin/scripts/generate-checksum.js utility for generating checksums
   - Adds manifest files with plugin checksums
   - Adds comprehensive tests for checksum verification
   - Adds documentation for the checksum verification system

   The implementation ensures that plugins downloaded during the build process or at runtime match their expected checksums, preventing security issues that could arise from corrupted or tampered plugin files.

   Fixes #2539
