# Checksum Verification Implementation

## Overview

This project implements checksum verification for plugin bundling scripts to address the security issue described in GitHub issue #2539. The implementation ensures that plugins downloaded during the build process or at runtime match their expected checksums, preventing security issues that could arise from corrupted or tampered plugin files.

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Plugin Bundling Scripts**:
   - `app/scripts/setup-plugins.js`: Enhanced with checksum verification
   - `container/fetch-plugins.sh`: Enhanced with checksum verification

2. **Manifest Files**:
   - `app/app-build-manifest.json`: Created with sample plugin data
   - `container/build-manifest.json`: Created with sample plugin data

3. **Utility Scripts**:
   - `plugins/headlamp-plugin/scripts/generate-checksum.js`: Created to generate and verify checksums
   - `scripts/implement-checksum-verification.js`: Created to automate the implementation
   - `scripts/test-checksum-verification.js`: Created to test the implementation

4. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/plugin-checksum-verification.md`: Created to document the implementation
   - `CHECKSUM-VERIFICATION.md`: This summary file

## Implementation Details

1. **Checksum Calculation**:
   - SHA256 is used as the hashing algorithm for checksums
   - Checksums are calculated for plugin packages and stored in manifest files

2. **Verification Process**:
   - When plugins are downloaded, their checksums are calculated and compared with the expected checksums
   - If a checksum doesn't match, the plugin is rejected, and an error is reported

3. **Manifest Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "plugin-name",
         "version": "1.0.0",
         "url": "https://example.com/plugins/plugin-name-1.0.0.tgz",
         "checksum": "sha256-checksum-value"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

1. **Checksum Calculation Test**:
   - Verifies that checksums are calculated correctly
   - Confirms that modified files produce different checksums

2. **Utility Test**:
   - Verifies that the generate-checksum.js utility works correctly
   - Confirms that it produces the same checksums as the direct calculation

3. **Manifest Update Test**:
   - Verifies that the utility can update manifest files with correct checksums

All tests have passed, confirming that the checksum verification implementation is working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Update all plugin manifest files with checksums for existing plugins
2. Integrate checksum verification into the plugin publishing process
3. Consider adding checksum verification to the plugin installation process in the UI
