## Test Results

All tests have passed, confirming that the checksum verification implementation is working correctly:

1. **Checksum Calculation Tests**
   - Checksums are calculated correctly
   - Checksums are valid SHA256 hashes
   - Modified files produce different checksums

2. **Checksum Verification Tests**
   - Valid checksums are verified successfully
   - Invalid checksums are rejected with appropriate error messages

3. **Manifest Handling Tests**
   - Manifest files are read correctly
   - Plugin information including checksums is extracted properly

4. **Utility Tests**
   - generate-checksum.js utility calculates checksums correctly
   - Utility can update manifest files with calculated checksums
