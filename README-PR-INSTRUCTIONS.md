This document provides instructions for pushing the checksum verification changes to GitHub and creating a pull request.

## Files Included

1. **push-changes.bat**: Script to push changes to GitHub
2. **create-pull-request.md**: Instructions for creating a pull request
3. **changes-summary.md**: Summary of the changes being pushed
4. **sign-cla.md**: Instructions for signing the CLA

## Steps to Follow

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub

1. Run the `push-changes.bat` script:
   ```
   push-changes.bat
   ```

   This script will:
   - Initialize a Git repository in the headlamp-55-Kallal directory
   - Add all files to the repository
   - Configure Git with a username and email
   - Commit the changes with a detailed commit message
   - Add the remote repository
   - Create a new branch called `add-checksum-verification`
   - Push the changes to GitHub

2. If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token).

### Step 2: Create a Pull Request

Follow the instructions in `create-pull-request.md` to create a pull request from your branch to the kubernetes-sigs/headlamp repository.

### Step 3: Sign the CLA

If the CLA check fails on your pull request, follow the instructions in `sign-cla.md` to sign the Contributor License Agreement.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Authentication Issues**: Make sure you're using a personal access token if you have two-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account.

2. **Push Failures**: If the push fails, try pushing manually:
   ```
   cd headlamp-55-Kallal
   git push -u origin add-checksum-verification
   ```

3. **Unrelated Changes**: If your branch contains unrelated changes, create a new branch with only the checksum verification changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b add-checksum-verification-clean
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   git push -u origin add-checksum-verification-clean
   ```

4. **CLA Issues**: If you have trouble signing the CLA, contact the Linux Foundation support team.
